    <p >During class I came to know that everything I can search on internet even suggestions for career. Later on, I started exploring internet in my batchmates phone. This was the time when negativeness towards my career infested around my mind that I should have gone for management stream and not for IT. Some how I completed my BCA and started thinking of pursuing MBA further. But in mean time, I get a set back from my family side and it was a time I had to take the responsibility of my family on my shoulders. So, I started appearing in Banking exams and get selected for Clerical services in Punjab National Bank and for Probationary Officer in Bank of Baroda. Seeing my family condition, I hurriedly joined Bank of Baroda. I got my first smart phone with my first salary. As I told earlier it was my hard work during my high school which help me most in getting these jobs as I was good at both mathematics and english which matter most in the Banking and SSC exams. Later I moved on and get selected for my current post.</p>
